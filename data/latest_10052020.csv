Hello SAPS
Â 
Has this been included with your payment remittance.Â  If so please advise the payment (check)# and full amount of payment so that I may research.Â  Graybar has numerous accounts  with Eaton so there will not be a refund sent.Â  Reach out to your Accounts Payable person for Eaton if you need assistance on how this allowance should be remitted.

That RMA noted below was applied back on 7/15/16 with check 51649217.
Â 
I believe the information you have was incorrect.Â  If it was applied in 2017 then it was in error and the amount is due and payable.

When Graybar takes a deduction, a copy is mailed out before payment is made.Â  This allows any disputes or questions to be asked.Â  In the future, please reach out as soon as possible. This payment was made in 2017.

Afternoon,
Â 
The above mentioned check had a credit taken but there was no referenced Credit Memo, so the amount has remained due and payable.
Â 
Please send backup information and relevant paperwork in regards to this credit.
Â 
The note I have says it was a credit for materials we did not receive back, so this amount needs to be reimbursed.

Sorry to come back to this so late. A unit price of 3.08/unit was deducted, but you were only billed $1.94/unit.

There was a 25% restocking fee and I am not sure why freight was deducted. Please adjust accordingly.

Has this been included with your payment remittance.Â  If so please advise the payment (check)# and full amount of payment so that I may research.Â  Graybar has numerous accounts  with Eaton so there will not be a refund sent.Â  Reach out to your Accounts Payable person for Eaton if you need assistance on how this allowance should be remitted.

Hi, Saps. I think I figured out why I Del and I canâ€™t access certain things( I think Del mentioned before).  I was trying to access the check below and could not. I retrieved it from our imaging system and tried to find the debit memos. Neither came up. I noticed Iâ€™ve been having this problem with a few checks and debit memos. I realized what the problem is. This  is under vendor code 1787886 only have access to vendor code 1778504. Â Can you provide the below debit memos so we can try to get these debits cleared

However, please send backup for the specific deduction. I have noted that Q1 2020 for Graybar would be 97K, is that what is being deducted?

I can issue a credit and we can have the team transfer between.
Â 
However, please send backup for the specific deduction. I have noted that Q1 2020 for Graybar would be 97K, is that what is being deducted?

This is scrap allowance for Cooper Lighting â€“ it isnâ€™t even our division.

Can you help with this?Â  How do you suggest resolving?

Hello SAPS
Â 
Has this been included with your payment remittance.Â  If so please advise the payment (check)# and full amount of payment so that I may research.Â  Graybar has numerous accounts  with Eaton so there will not be a refund sent.Â  Reach out to your Accounts Payable person for Eaton if you need assistance on how this allowance should be remitted.

Hello Ms. Michelle
Itâ€™s been a long time that we havenâ€™t heard anything from you regarding this matter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  THIS IS JUST A RECAP FROM PREVIOUS EMAIL:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Iâ€™m so sorry for dragging this again as this is an old debit under your account as your deduction of $10,000.00 (deducted from check#30145239) was denied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  After thorough investigation and searching of all the documents related to your PO# 4702649951 we cannot find any paper works that this labor charge  has been authorized by Elite.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  However if you have the authorization coming from Elite regarding this labor charges please forward it to us, so that we can submit it to the person  in charge of your account.
Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Nevertheless, if you cannot provide Elite Authorization please reverse your debit and pay us back your balance of $10,000.00.
Â 
Since we never received any documentation from you - Â please advise schedule of payment on your balance of $10,000.00 ASAP as this has been long overdue.

I can issue a credit and we can have the team transfer between.
Â 
However, please send backup for the specific deduction. I have noted that Q1 2020 for Graybar would be 97K, is that what is being deducted?

Hi Danielle,
Â 
Graybar did not deduct â€“ at least not on the Power Quality side. Â They are waiting for this scrap allowance.
Â 
Do you see a deduction on the Cooper Lighting side?Â  Iâ€™m assuming you issue a credit to offset a deduction?

Hi Danielle,
Â 
Graybar did not deduct â€“ at least not on the Power Quality side. Â They are waiting for this scrap allowance.
Â 
Do you see a deduction on the Cooper Lighting side?Â  Iâ€™m assuming you issue a credit to offset a deduction?

Hello Matt,Â 






Understood.


We paid the invoice for the Trade show ($9,000) on 11/14/2019. Check#3471 and it shows cleared in the bank. We sent it to the incorrect address. It was sent to:Â 
Graybar
File 57071
Los Angeles CA 90074


Total check amount was $17,241.43
Included on the check were the below invoices:
Trade show 20190531
9312999283
9312400270
9313075312
9313075313


For this account, we get a 1% Discount if we pay within 15 days so we mistakenly took the discount. For the invoice 20190531 we still owe you $90.00.Â 


Then on check#00768610 we saw the 9,000 deduction. We never receivedÂ a check back for it so this was paid in November and included as a credit in March.Â 


Let me know if you haveÂ any questions and thank you for your help on this,Â

Hello Saps,Â 

 
Yes. The 9,000 was for a training conference, but we paid it on 11/14/2019. We mistakenly paid it to Graybar: File 57071 Los Angeles CA 90074. We thought it was for this branch but it wasn't. We paid it as $8,910.00 so we owe you $90.00. Check#3471. Please  see below. Then this was deducted on the check. This invoice was paid then deducted on check# from subject line. No one reached out to us regarding this.Â

Good morning Matt,Â 

Â  

I'm a littleÂ confused. Could you please clarify?Â  

Â  

We receivedÂ an invoice back in 2019 under invoice#20190531 for $9,000.00. This was paid on 11-14-19. I realized we short paid it by $90.00. This shows cleared on our end.Â  

Â  

Then I received check#00768610 and I noticed the invoice # is being used as a credit note on the check for $9,000.00.Â  

Â  

Please advise.Â

Hi Matt - 

Â  

Thank you for your response. I have attached the open invoice to this email. Here you will see the line item stating that ""half freight  is allowed to the continental United States."" I reviewed the Sales order as well as the original Quote and I see that information as well. I am cc'ing our Sales team as maybe they have more insight and could be of more assistance.

Good morning Lyndsey,
Regarding the freight deduction of $150.92 taken on invoice 45079, we are showing PO 4703049352 as freight allowed.Â  Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.

Aloha Graybar Team - 

Â  

We received a payment remittance for invoice 45079 that was short the freight that charged. Subsequently we received Debt Memo #5110406919,  Purchase Order # 4703049352, location ID TAFL. Our vendor # is 249664. 

Â  

The amount of this freight charge was $150.92. Our Office manager has reviewed the original PO that was sent by Graybar Electric which  does not indicate that we were to use the customer's freight account. OnÂ both our original quote #18800 Â and sales order #36194 stated Â½ freight allowed. 

Â  

Could you please advise when the remaining balance of this invoice will be paid?

Hi Kayla,
Â 
DMQ0000573051 is not a valid credit. The â€œquantity varianceâ€ for that invoice was paid back using CM 577354 which was taken on CK#30347372 as 0000577354.
Â 
We double shipped and Graybar paid one invoice but also took the credit, therefore the second invoice also needs to be paid.

For PO 4518986154 that invoice was prepaid, we received a freight bill for all shipments, so we are  still in a situation where this one is a mystery.Â  We have 5 freight bills total for this PO
Â

There is an open RMA on this order for invoice 1571332, you did not sign damaged however we are still  allowing a return, the RMA number is 31302.Â  This material has not been received back yet by the way!
We sent a replacement shipment
Â

Candice,
Looking on check 30369001, I do not see a deduction taken by Graybar.
Deduction DMF390200666583 taken on check 30373402 is for freight charged to Graybar by FedEx Freight on PO 4518986154.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed.Â  Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.

Matt,
Â 
I went to correct this invoice and see that you paid this invoice on check number 30369001 on 3/10.Â   We did apply your discount to this payment.Â  However the deduction was taken on check 30373402 on 3/18/2020.Â  So I am still in a situation where I donâ€™t know what this deduction is for.Â  I have attached a copy of your check stub for reference.Â  It is the last  line on this payment.
Â 
When looking at the payment stub, I see more information than what was typed on the original debit.Â   It says Freight charged in error.Â  But this was a prepaid order so there was no freight charged. There were actually a few shipments on this PO.Â  We had invoice 1571332, 1571234 and 1571652(that you referenced).Â  All three invoices are attached for your reference  in case you need them.Â 
Â 
Because it has to be difficult, there is a RMA open on invoice 1571332.Â  We have not received the material  back, but I have attached RMA 31302 to this email as well.Â  (just in case that provides you with any clues).
Â 
Let me know if any of this helps determine the cause for this deduction.

Good morning. Please confirm. Iâ€™m a little confused. Our records indicate that the first shipment was refused and returned to my warehouse in Goldsboro NC. A second shipment was sent out and that is what you  are saying has been received by your customer. We did bill you twice, so at this point the only action that needs to be taken is to issue a credit for the first invoice to Graybar.
Is this correct?

Please give me a little time on that answer. Iâ€™m being told that the package has already been returned to my warehouse. For whatever reason the shipment came back and we had instructions to reenter the order  and reship. A credit should have been issued for the first invoice. Thatâ€™s where our mistake was.
Iâ€™m waiting for the tracking number on the return to be sent to me.

Regarding the freight deduction of $28.80 taken on invoice 2020-214490-00, PO 4519364057 shows as freight allowed on orders over $1000.00.Â  Since the PO total is over $1000.00, Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.

Yes, I would normally wait for a deduction and then issue a credit.

Hi Danielle,
Â 
Graybar did not deduct â€“ at least not on the Power Quality side. Â They are waiting for this scrap allowance.
Â 
Do you see a deduction on the Cooper Lighting side?Â  Iâ€™m assuming you issue a credit to offset a deduction?

I can issue a credit and we can have the team transfer between.
Â 
However, please send backup for the specific deduction. I have noted that Q1 2020 for Graybar would be 97K, is that what is being deducted?

Hello SAPS
Â 
Has this been included with your payment remittance.Â  If so please advise the payment (check)# and full amount of payment so that I may research.Â  Graybar has numerous accounts  with Eaton so there will not be a refund sent.Â  Reach out to your Accounts Payable person for Eaton if you need assistance on how this allowance should be remitted.

Deduction DMF610975081 is for freight charged to Graybar by Southeastern Freight under PO 4518980343.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed on orders over $7500.00.Â   Since the PO total is $8896.26, Graybar should not have been charged freight by Southeastern Freight on this shipment.

Hi Elena,
Â 
This is due, because the invoice was not paid. It should have been a wash with Invoice 70854085 and the CM. But the invoice was deducted against. Causing 2 deductions against this. So I have the deduction for  $1053.66 and an Invoice for $1053.66. But only one credit for the $1053.66. So I need the payment of either the invoice or the deduction paid back to close this out.
Â 
Thank you,
Â

I have reached back out for the RMA.Â  I was able to locate more information on deduction 5110290629.Â  This ties back to PO 4518163000, invoice 2092444711. 

Â  

Matt T 

Â  

I am now denying this deduction taken.Â  I have been asking for a couple of months for the RMA.Â  I can only assume since there is no RMA in our system  that this was a warranty RMA that is not subject to credit.Â  Please issue payback for the deduction.
Â 
Best regards

Matt,


I understand your records show ck#00761533 (which was only $1.25) paidÂ  invoiceÂ #0640.


I am inquiring about debit memo #5111724830 in the amount of $210, which I have attached below. As previously explained, this credit was authorized to Graybar via credit memo #0631, which is also attached below. This credit in the amount of $210 was applied to invoice #0640 (which is clearly stated on the credit memo attached) since this invoice was for the replacementÂ parts on credit memo #0631 (the replacementÂ parts were ordered while the malfunctioning units were being shipped back to us for evaluation). This credit was applied to this invoice since they are corresponding transactions.


Since this credit had alreadyÂ been applied to an unpaid invoice on Graybar'sÂ account (before ck#00761533 was received), the debit memo #5111724830 should not have been issued by Graybar (the credit had already been applied to Graybar's account so there was no reason for them to take the credit a second time).


As mentioned above, I understand ck#00761533 in the amount of $1.25 was for invoice #0640, however, since credit memo #0631 was already applied to this invoice fully, debit memo #5111724830 was not authorized. Please advise when a chargeback in the amount of $210.00 has been made, and let me know if you have any questions.


Thank you,

In addition to this, I have attached the other unauthorized debit memo below for $210.00. This credit was given to Graybar, however since this had already been applied to an unpaid invoice, the debit should not have been taken .

Good afternoon,

Â  

Thank you for the information and attachments that you have provided. 

Â  

In regards of RMA #0669, I have attached this below, which clearly states that this credit was not authorized for reasons that are explained on the RMA. This information was relayed back toÂ jessie.wise@graybar.comÂ in  September 2019 (email chain attached below), but after explaining the circumstances, we no longer received any more responses from him so we assumed the customer no longer wantedÂ the units.Â  

Â  

Also, even if this credit was given to Graybar, the total should have been $498.75 (3 units x $166.25 per unit) and not $551.85. I am assuming the additional $53.10 is shipping that GLC is not responsible for as we do not cover the return  freight charges. We only cover the shipping and handling to return the units back to the customer. Overall, this credit was unauthorized and must be paid back in full. 

Â  

In regards of RMA #0631, this credit was already applied to the invoice #0640, which I have attached below as well. This invoice was for the replacement parts for RMA #0631 while the units were getting sent back to us for evaluation. I  have attached the email that this was explained on to the rep. Furthermore, this debit needs to be paid back as well as it has already been applied. 

Â  

I apologize for any confusion this has caused, but hopefully all of this information helps Graybar understand this issue. Please advise when we should be receiving payment for these, and let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Â  

Thank you very much,

Hi David,

We are receiving the checks at our Fremont office, instead request you to ask the AP team to send the checks directly to our lockbox or pay by ACH.
Â 
I am not sure, if you are the right point of contact for this or you can share the email address with whom I can work.

Â 
Hello,

 I am emailing you to inquire about the outstanding balances you have on some invoices. Please see the list below list as reference. The outstanding amount is all there is left to be paid on each invoice. Since the amount outstanding and the sales tax don't match on all of them, I thought I would email to double check that this is in fact a tax issue.

 If these outstanding balances are in fact related to sales tax, please send an updated tax exemption certificate so we can adjust the remaining balances on these invoices.

 If it is not a tax issue, could you give me some insight as to why the full invoices have not been paid?

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thanks for looking into this issue.
Â 
We billed Freight Collect as we do on every other location. If you speak with Paul Weiblen , he can explain the issue better. My understanding is that it was incorrectly set up as a Freight allowed PO, when it should have been set up as  a freight Collect Shipment. We had the same issue on a previous Invoice and Paul was able to work with the AP Department at Graybar and get that corrected and sent to us.
Â 
Please let me know if I can be of help in getting this straightened out.

Thanks,

Hello Paul,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We just received a payment for Invoice 170210. There is a deduction of $46.76 for freight on PO4519239496.
Â 
I know you and Pat had talked about this same issue on a previous Invoice. The Invoice was freight allowed and should have been freight charged. Â Could you look into this for me?
Â 

 Thanks,
Matthew Frazier

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid.

Hi Matt!
Â 
We had permission from the Allentown branch to deliver this via our truck at $125.00.
Â 
Please see attached email between myself and Veronica from January.
Â 
We were able to save you guys around $175.00 on freight.
Â 
I always check with you guys before we ship anything other than collectâ€¦ is there an option to select prepaid and add to avoid this for future orders?

 Thanks!

Good afternoon Briana, 

Â  

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid. 

Â  

Thank you, 

Â

Good Morning!
Â 
Please see attached invoice: 128445
Â 
$137.50 is still due on this, and itâ€™s now over 90 days past due.
Â 
Please advise as to when we may see paymentâ€¦ Graybar in Greensboro, NC placed an order with us this morning, and Iâ€™m unable to process it until this is cleared up.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you for your help with this!

Good afternoon Briana, 

Â  

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid. 

Â  

Thank you, 

Â

Good Morning!
Â 
Please see attached invoice: 128445
Â 
$137.50 is still due on this, and itâ€™s now over 90 days past due.
Â 
Please advise as to when we may see paymentâ€¦ Graybar in Greensboro, NC placed an order with us this morning, and Iâ€™m unable to process it until this is cleared up.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you for your help with this!

 Thanks!

Sorry,â€¦.I am only seeing a payment of $396.48 towards invoice 128445 and a remaining balance of 137.50.
Â 
Was there a separate payment for the 125.00 sent recently that maybe we have not received yet? If so, what are those payment details, and what is the remaining 12.50 representing?

Hi Matt!
Â 
We had permission from the Allentown branch to deliver this via our truck at $125.00.
Â 
Please see attached email between myself and Veronica from January.
Â 
We were able to save you guys around $175.00 on freight.
Â 
I always check with you guys before we ship anything other than collectâ€¦ is there an option to select prepaid and add to avoid this for future orders?

Good afternoon ~
Â 
Graybar deducted freight due to non-compliance issues.Â  Graybar's purchase order shipping instructions requested to ship collect UPS or LTL.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, Graybar deducted the  freight for non-compliance.
Â 
Based on the PO you provided, I do not see shipping instructions.Â  A chargeback has been submitted for review/processing in the amount of $149.30.

Â 
Pam,
We received the payment, but can you tell me why you are not paying the shipping charge? From the PO, there arenâ€™t shipping instructions, so we shipped it best way and add. I donâ€™t think this is the first time weâ€™ve had problems with the  shipping charges being paid.
Â 
Thank you,
Â

Good afternoon ~

Hi Matt!

We had permission from the Allentown branch to deliver this via our truck at $125.00.
Â 
Please see attached email between myself and Veronica from January.
Â 
We were able to save you guys around $175.00 on freight.
Â 
I always check with you guys before we ship anything other than collectâ€¦ is there an option to select prepaid and add to avoid this for future orders?

Good afternoon Briana, 

Â  

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid.

Good morning,Â 
Â 
Your order has been shipped via R+L, they are a good carrier, however,PLEASE HAVE THE RECEIVERS CHECK FOR ANY DAMAGE AND CONFIRM THE COMPLETE ORDER HAS BEEN RECEIVED BEFORE SIGNING THE BOL, you have the right to do this.Â 
Â 
We do all we can to carefully package the order for shipment, but accidents can happen with the carrier and if it does, this will make the claims process quicker to have  a BOL signed stating that the order arrived with damage, take pictures if possible. This helps protect you and us.Â Â Â 
Â 
Here is the tracking link,https://www2.rlcarriers.com/freight/shipping/shipment-tracing.Â  Your tracking number is01662645-6

Good afternoon,
Â 
Payment has posted and the ship date is still correct, though please also let us know about the below.
Â 
As situations change across the country regarding COVID-19, we are trying to plan for shipments that may need to be held in our warehouse now that some areas are being asked to shelter  in place. We have received notice from our transportation carriers that they will not be able to keep shipments in their facilities, so if something needs to be held we will need to know before it is shipped out.
Â 
Please let us know if you are still in a position to receive orders, and keep us updated if your situation changes!

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 GENERAL: All orders are subject to acceptance of the Home Office of the company in New York. Title to merchandise passes to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier (unless our own trucks) regardless of whether-or-not transportation charges are paid or allowed  by the company. All orders are accepted contingent on our ability to secure necessary materials and labor. We do not assume responsibility for incomplete or delayed execution of orders. In the case of any special equipment described by catalog numbers which  do not appear in our price guide, we reserve the right to quote and sell only to the distributor who led us to develop this design for his customer.

 TERMS: 1% 10 Days Net 30 for credit approved open accounts. There will be a $10.00 handling charge added on orders totaling les than $100.00 net. PAST DUE ACCOUNTS: SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CHARGE EQUAL TO Â½% PER MONTH, BUT IN NO EVENT HIGHER THAN PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE LAW. In addition to such late payment service charges, costs and expenses associated with collection of past due amounts, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, shall be added to the amounts past due.

 DELIVERY: All shipments F.O.B., New Windsor, NY with surface freight allowed as follows (based on selling price value of individual shipments). Overnight shipments are not allowed regardless of value and carrier account numbers must be supplied. Partial releases  or shipments processed at the customerâ€™s request will be subject to these same allowances: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island $3,000.00 or more East of Mississippi River $3,500.00 or more West of Mississippi River $5,000.00 or more For shipments  of $5,000.00 or more to AK or HI, freight will be allowed to the West Coast. Freight from the West Coast to the final destination will be charged. For shipments to CN: Ontario East US $3,500.00 or more Manitoba West US $5,000.00 or more CN allowances are subject  to change subject to currency fluctuation.

 IMPORTANT:
 Freight allowances apply only to the base freight charges from the carrier. Any additional or extraordinary charges are not allowed and will be invoiced. This includes, but is not limited to, the following extra charges:
 - Call before notification â€“ Early AM delivery
 - Liftgate â€“ Residential/church delivery
 - Pallet jack â€“ Re-consignment fees
 - Fuel surcharge â€“ Local difficult delivery surcharges
 These are project specific charges over which we have no control, and as such, are not incorporated in our pricing.

 SHORTAGES/DAMAGES
 I.C.C. regulations state that all claims for SHORTAGES and DAMAGES (both visible and concealed) must be entered against the carrier within 15 days from receipt of shipment. Absolutely no claim will be allowed beyond 15 days. In case of loss or damage in transit,  consignee must make all claims with delivering carrier within normal time limits established by the I.C.C. We suggest immediate inspection of goods when received, and prompt filing of claims in case of breakage.

 RETURNS POLICY: All sales are final. However, in some cases returns may be allowed within 90 days after original shipment date. No products will be accepted for return without our written approval and unless accompanied by a properly authorized written â€˜Return  Authorization Requestâ€™ initiated by an appropriate USAI Employee. Return freight must be pre-paid. For non-special or non-custom products accepted for return a credit will be issued at the price invoiced, from which will be deducted the expense for return  transportation (if not prepaid) and a minimum restocking charge of 50% of the invoice value. Material returned without authorization will be accepted with no credit issued. Products appropriately returned for defects in material and workmanship, or error in  shipment will be accepted for full credit without service charge. Special or custom-made products including units that are modified from standard units cannot be returned for credit. Orders with an invoice value of less than $100.00 are not subject to return.

 WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY: USAI products, when properly installed and under normal conditions of use, are warranted to our customers only to be free from defects in material and workmanship at the time of shipment. All warranty claims must be asserted within  one year from the date of shipment of the subject items; thereafter warranty claims will not be honored. Customerâ€™s sole remedy for a warranty claim or otherwise shall be limited to repair or replacement of the subject product if it is shown to have been defective  in material or workmanship at the time of shipment. USAIâ€™s sole and maximum liability for a defective product shall never exceed the cost of the subject product. Except for such warranty and exclusive remedy as stated, (and the express warranty of title),  we disclaim all other warranties, whether expressed or implied and specifically disclaim the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event shall we be liable to customer in warranty, contract negligence, strict liability  or otherwise, for any damages, whether incidental or consequential which are alleged to be caused by one or more of our products, beyond the cost to the customer of the subject product or products. Therefore, the customerâ€™s sole and exclusive remedy against  us for breach of warranty, breach of contract, or in negligence or in strict liability or otherwise shall be limited to repair or replacement of the subject product at our option (excluding installation and removal charges which shall not be our liability)  or, if we choose, to refund the purchase price.

Hi Michael,
Â 
The W8 is perfect, because it is signed and dated. However, to move forward with the new vendor set up process you need to add Bullit Groupâ€™s remit address on the  second tab in the middle of the page.
Â 

Â 
Please resubmit your request with the updated SG. I will then send this to my team to review this vendor to see if a COI is even needed to proceed. If it is and  we need any sort of changes they will email Dan and CC you with what is required.
Â 
Once this vendor is set up, you will be notified.
Â 
Thanks,
Â 
Lauren

Hello Vendor Maintenance Team,
Â 
Appreciate your help on this.
Â 
Bullitt Mobile LLC is based out of the UK, I am not sure if that is an issue moving forward. The original COI showed it was for their sales office in Charlotte.
Â 
They have sent over a revised COI which now matches the address on the W8BEN for their Headquarters in the UK. These two documents are attached. Â 
Â 
I also included an email chain from Bullitt Groupâ€™s financial department with their explanation, if that helps.
Â 
The COI is addressed to whom it may concern. I was told documents should be addressed to Graybar and relayed that information to them. Please see attached email chain. Bullitt is having a difficult time doing this with their insurance and  was wondering if there is another way to show this. Â 
Â 
Please advise if their documentation is okay to proceed.
Â 
Thanks,
Â

It is required that the remit address is added to the SG368 form. The auditors will mark the request as incomplete if the SG368 does not show a remit-to address.  Please update the SG with the below address and resubmit your request with the SG368 and all other attachments.

Good morning Mac,

Â  

I will need you to provide your company's banking and credit information to establish a line of credit for Graybar.Â

Please see attached for Stout's W-9 and certificateÂ of insurance. Also attached is our customer credit application.

Thank you,

Also I will be sending a formal quotation to you in regards to the GE quote you requested. I apologize for the delay but it has taken some additionalÂ time to identify the correct component needed however, this has been successfully completed.

Good Morning Colton,
Â 
Spoke with my manager and I was advised to get you formally set up in our system. I just need a Certificate of Insurance and W-9. Iâ€™m looking forward to writing some business with  you guys. Our customer is expanding in Wind Energy a lot and Iâ€™m hoping this can be a way for us to break into that segment.

We received your CC payment of 1918.55 on 05/26/2020 and thankÂ you for your payment.Â  We noticed that several of the invoices were paid short ( tax excluded from payment )

I have attached a list of all states we are required to collect sales tax in.Â  Â If you ship to any of the states noted below you must submitÂ a resale cert or we will have to charge tax.


We are registered to collect sales tax in the following states:

Dear Michael,
Â 
I need to ask you for some assistance. I have attached 2 invoices for your recent purchase orders that have shipped. Due to the current COVID 19 situation, the person that would normally be handling this is out of the office indefinitely.  I am working from home and have jumped in to help.
Â 
When the first purchase order came in there was confusion as to your account and payment terms. You are in our system as a pre-pay with a credit card. Are you the contact for getting that information or could you put me in touch with who  is? I would like to get this matter resolved as soon as possible. I appreciate your assistance.

Good afternoon Jane, 

Â  

Looking at your account, Mikalor is already set to be paid via check. 

Â  

Thank you,

Hello,
Â 
I am reaching out today to see about getting authorization to change Graybarâ€™s account with Mikalor to payment method via Check. It is currently payment method via Credit Card,  but it has been brought to our attention that many of your buyers prefer to pay by check.
Â 
Could I please get confirmation that this change is accepted?
Â 
FYI: Graybarâ€™s account is prepaid, therefore we will not be able to ship product until we receive payment, whether that is calling for a CC or a waiting for a check in the mail. There is a 3.5% convenience fee for CC payments.
Â 
Please advise
Â 
Regards, Jane

HI Matt:
Â 
Here is another one that you deducted freight on that you need to pay.Â  Please see email below between us and Rick Thomas telling us to prepay and add the freight because there was not a freight number on your PO.Â  Lisa called Rick and he said to prepay and add.Â  I will short pay the invoice P56534 and that will leave a balance of $93.77 (freight) and you can pay that on your next credit card payment.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions.Â  Lisa said Rick told her ya'll were trying to get your customers to give you their freight numbers to charge the freight to but were having some issues with getting that done.
Â 
Thanks,

Where did you get that it would be freight allowed? We do not have anyone set up on freight allowed. Your original PO showed freight and that is the PO that was accepted. We did not authorize anything to go freight allowed. The freight needs to be paid.

Good afternoon Robin,
Regarding the freight deduction of $469.64 taken on invoice 04082038B, we are showing PO 4519297080 as freight allowed.Â  Since the PO is freight allowed, Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.
Thank you,
Matt T
Â 
Hi-Â 
Â 
Are you able to tell me if PO-Â 4519297080 is in the system to be paidÂ in the full amount ofÂ $10,479.67.
We received a debit memo in the amount of 469.64, your invoice 5110658865. This is a freight charge (shipping) that needs to be paid in full with the rest of the invoice. This was not billed in error. The shipping cost was also listed on your PO as well.Â

Graybar deducted freight due to non-compliance issues.Â  Graybar's purchase order shipping instructions requested to ship collect UPS or LTL.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, Graybar deducted the  freight for non-compliance.
Â 
Based on the PO you provided, I do not see shipping instructions.Â  A chargeback has been submitted for review/processing in the amount of $149.30.

We received the payment, but can you tell me why you are not paying the shipping charge? From the PO, there arenâ€™t shipping instructions, so we shipped it best way and add. I donâ€™t think this is the first time weâ€™ve had problems with the  shipping charges being paid.

Hi,
One of my reps just took over your net account. We are learning how to use your portal. Per the portal invoice 67419429 was paid in April 2019. I have attached a snap shot of the portal showing this information. I have also attached the remit that I pulled  out of the portal.
I do not show that we received this payment. Per the remit it should be for $764.81. I do not show that we ever charged this amount. Can you check to see if this amount was charged. If it was not charged could you reissue the payment?

Hi Matt,
Â 
Please see below, this is what we have. Iâ€™m not sure what else you need from our end to have this fixed. Right now, we are short the $130.00 from inv# 606235 and the last time we  spoke, you said you will need to look into it. Not sure if you got any updates? Please see my notes below.
Â 
Deduction LT605894 in the amount of $30.00 was created to accept CM LT605894.â€“ inv# 605886 was never paid for and we issued CM 605894 to cancel this invoice out so Iâ€™m not sure why there is a $30.00 deduction. It was then re-issued on inv# 605895 which has been paid per your attached excel on chq# 30318035  along with inv# 606167. The issue I think is because Graybar used CM 605894 as a credit to apply onto their payment but shouldnâ€™t have because inv# 605886 wasnâ€™t paid for so technically there is not credit to use.
Regarding Deduction 1930697793 in the amount of $100.00, I have reached out for the review status and will let you know once I hear back.â€“ not sure if you heard back on this?

Hi Matt,
Â 
I think there might have been a misunderstanding. Credit memo# 605894 (see attached) was issued to cancel inv# 605886 (see attached) which was never paid for so there shouldnâ€™t  be a credit/deduction for Graybar to use towards payment. We just issued it to cancel out that invoice so we can re-issue a new one. We then re-issued inv# 605895 to replace inv# 605886.

There was no freight deduction on the chq stub, but our invoice amount is $33,190.00 USD (see attached) however the payment we received was just $33,000.00 so there is still $190.00  outstanding. Unfortunately, there wasnâ€™t any reference of why it was deducted. Please advise.

HI Matt:
Â 
Here is another one that you deducted freight on that you need to pay.Â  Please see email below between us and Rick Thomas telling us  to prepay and add the freight because there was not a freight number on your PO.Â  Lisa called Rick and he said to prepay and add.Â  I will short pay the invoice P56534 and that will leave a balance of $93.77 (freight) and you can pay that on your next credit  card payment.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions.Â  Lisa said Rick told her ya'll were trying to get your customers to give you their freight  numbers to charge the freight to but were having some issues with getting that done.

No, freight was not charged on the invoice from Tripp Lite; however, FedEx billed Graybar for freight for this PO (see attached EDI invoice from FedEx, which Graybar paid). The freight was billed collect to Graybar, so Graybar paid the  freight bill and deducted the freight from Tripp Lite.

Good Afternoon,
Â 
No, freight was not charged on the invoice from Tripp Lite; however, FedEx billed Graybar for freight for this PO (see attached EDI invoice from FedEx, which Graybar paid). The freight was billed collect to Graybar, so Graybar paid the  freight bill and deducted the freight from Tripp Lite.

Good Afternoon,
Â 
No, freight was not charged on the invoice from Tripp Lite; however, FedEx billed Graybar for freight for this PO (see attached EDI invoice from FedEx, which Graybar paid). The freight was billed collect to Graybar, so Graybar paid the  freight bill and deducted the freight from Tripp Lite.

Hi Christine,

Â  

Thank you for checking into this, reallyÂ appreciateÂ it! This puts our company in a bind however, we are a small company and can not be out over 60 days and need to be in our terms of 30 days, which crushesÂ us in cash flow. We have another  invoiceÂ out and working on another project as we speak. 

Not sure if you can reach out to someone or please provide a contact for me to speak/email with. Looking forwardÂ to many new projects with you guys but going out that long is just to muchÂ of a strain on us.

Good Morning Melissa,
Â 
Apologies for the late response.Â  Please provide Ditekâ€™s current, signed and dated W-9. I need that for documentation purposes for submitting the change of address. Also, Ditekâ€™s Dallas address does not show on the invoices as they are  EDI (see snip below), so please provide the remit address.Â  Once that has been approved and completed, I will submit a stop payment and re-issue for check 20023534.Â  I have everything prepared for submission.

Please advise what you are requesting from Graybar.Â  Is Werner disputing the deduction? Does Graybar need to provide original PO number? Does Graybar need to provide POD?
Â 

 Thank you,

Good Afternoon Jennifer and Tracy,
The attached report shows current and past due balances.Â  While we appreciate the struggles of breaking in a new system, vendors should not have to wait for payment on services  completed in January to be paid.Â  That is unacceptable.Â  Please respond and let me know when we can we expect your account to be brought current?Â  Â

Hello Matt,Â  


Â  

Â  

Understood. 

Â  

We paid the invoice for the Trade show ($9,000) on 11/14/2019. Check#3471 and it shows cleared in the bank. We sent it to the incorrect address. It was sent to:Â  

Graybar 

File 57071 

Los Angeles CA 90074 

Â  

Total check amount was $17,241.43 

Included on the check were the below invoices: 

Trade show 20190531 

9312999283 

9312400270 

9313075312 

9313075313 

Â  

For this account, we get a 1% Discount if we pay within 15 days so we mistakenly took the discount. For the invoice 20190531 we still owe you $90.00.Â  

Â  

Then on check#00768610 we saw the 9,000 deduction. We never receivedÂ a check back for it so this was paid in November and included as a credit in March.Â  

Â  

Let me know if you haveÂ any questions and thank you for your help on this,Â  

Â

Hello Saps,Â 

Â  

Yes. The 9,000 was for a training conference, but we paid it on 11/14/2019. We mistakenly paid it to Graybar: File 57071 Los Angeles CA 90074. We thought it was for this branch but it wasn't. We paid it as $8,910.00 so we owe you $90.00.  Check#3471. Please see below. Then this was deducted on the check. This invoice was paid then deducted on check# from subject line. No one reached out to us regarding this.Â

Â 
These 2 invoices relate to chargebacks that we have already credited.Â 
Â 
Invoice 5110833656 references PO Number 4519149878 and RMA 67998182 for $468.Â  Graybar returned the equipment to Eaton and are now reinvoicing for that amount. However, we already issued CM 966413318 for $468.Â 
Â 
Invoice 5110623042 -Looks like the original invoice was 53550277 with a freight charge of $1,201.91. This invoice was paid on payment 30394569 in May 2020 & freight was credited and cleared via CM53817562.

Both of these invoices will be cleared out of our system as they are not valid. Feel free to reach out should you have any questions. Thank you

Hello Matt,Â 

Â 
Â 
Understood.
Â 
We paid the invoice for the Trade show ($9,000) on 11/14/2019. Check#3471 and it shows cleared in the bank. We sent it to the incorrect address. It was sent to:Â 
Graybar
File 57071
Los Angeles CA 90074
Â 
Total check amount was $17,241.43
Included on the check were the below invoices:
Trade show 20190531
9312999283
9312400270
9313075312
9313075313
Â 
For this account, we get a 1% Discount if we pay within 15 days so we mistakenly took the discount. For the invoice 20190531 we still owe you $90.00.Â 
Â 
Then on check#00768610 we saw the 9,000 deduction. We never receivedÂ a check back for it so this was paid in November and included as a credit in March.Â 
Â 
Let me know if you haveÂ any questions and thank you for your help on this,Â 
Â

Hello Saps,Â 
Â 
Yes. The 9,000 was for a training conference, but we paid it on 11/14/2019. We mistakenly paid it to Graybar: File 57071 Los Angeles CA 90074. We thought it was for this branch but it wasn't. We paid it as $8,910.00 so we owe you $90.00. Check#3471. Please  see below. Then this was deducted on the check. This invoice was paid then deducted on check# from subject line. No one reached out to us regarding this.Â

Good morning Matt,Â 

Â  

I'm a littleÂ confused. Could you please clarify?Â  

Â  

We receivedÂ an invoice back in 2019 under invoice#20190531 for $9,000.00. This was paid on 11-14-19. I realized we short paid it by $90.00. This shows cleared on our end.Â  

Â  

Then I received check#00768610 and I noticed the invoice # is being used as a credit note on the check for $9,000.00.Â

Good morning Carmen,
Â 
Regarding reference 20190531, this was deducted once.Â  Deducted on check 00768610, dated 2/25/2020.
Â 
I do see that there was a payment and then a deduction that offset as well.Â  Since this offset, there is only 1 deduction.
Â

Good morning,
Regarding the freight deduction of $820.00 taken on invoice 1412347,Â Graybar deducted freight due to non-compliance issues.Â Â Graybar's purchase order shipping instructions requested to ship collect UPS or LTL.Â Â Since these instructions were not followed,  Graybar deducted the freight for non-compliance.

Jennifer,
Â 
Thank you for providing the check and reference numbers.
Â 
Deduction DMF610975081 is for freight charged to Graybar by Southeastern Freight under PO 4518980343.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed on  orders over $7500.00.Â  Since the PO total is $8896.26, Graybar should not have been charged freight by Southeastern Freight on this shipment.
Â 
I apologize, but I cannot provide a debit memo copy for the above deduction.
Â 


Thank you.

Iâ€™m checking in on your account with a couple small balances due on older invoices that I think may have been overlooked because of your excellent payment history with ECP.
Â 
I have attached todayâ€™s aging report as well as the two invoices with questions.Â  The two invoices are as follows:
Â 
34987 was paid but for whatever reason it has a small balance due of $225.43
35019 has not been paid and it also is a small balance due of $370.27

Good morning Kris,
Looking at the below freight deductions, this were not charged by Lyte Poles Inc, but by the freight carriers.Â  Please see the notes below.
Deduction DMF317261560 is for freight charged to Graybar by UPS under PO 4703082808.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed on orders over $1500.00.Â  Since the PO is over $1500.00, Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this  PO.
Deduction DMF770100303896Â is for freight charged to Graybar by FedExÂ under PO 4703085319.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed.Â  Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.

Good morning Kris,
Looking at the below freight deductions, this were not charged by Lyte Poles Inc, but by the freight carriers.Â  Please see the notes below.
Deduction DMF317261560 is for freight charged to Graybar by UPS under PO 4703082808.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed on orders over $1500.00.Â  Since the PO is over $1500.00, Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this  PO.
Deduction DMF770100303896Â is for freight charged to Graybar by FedExÂ under PO 4703085319.Â  We are showing the PO as freight allowed.Â  Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.

Hi Laura,
Sorry for the late response, but I attached your Debit                 Memos with my notes along with our Credit to you.
Your Debit# 5112330385 does Not shows the 50%                 Restocking.
Debit# 5112405321 is good as it shows the 50%                 restocking.
Our Invoice is for the total ofÂ  your two Debit Memo's                 which is fro 11 fixtures at $241.50ea
Balance due back to Cole is $2,173.50
Also, I am trying to match some more Debits but need 3                 Debit memos.
Can you send Inv# 5110035279, 5110085995                   & 5110169058

Â 
I apologize for not getting back to you sooner but we have been short staffed due to the Covid-19 stay at home orders. Attached is the original email from Steven Black and purchase  order #4518879094 showing the freight terms crossed out and PPD-Bill written in its place. This is why we did not ship UPS Collect or LTL Collect. Please advise when the freight amount of $226.53 will be sent.

In regards to your Chargeback for material you claim was not returned on our GRAYBAR STOCK ROTATION RETURN PO#6202342050
The location originating that return shipment states that the material involved in the chargeback was in fact included in the shipment
Â 
I would request that this be revisited with the receiving warehouse to ascertain if the shipping carton was damaged in any way?
And if it was signed for with exception?
Was any notification of this discrepancy sent to anyone at Graybar previous to this May dated chargeback?
Â 
At this time,
we must put this chargeback into Disputed Status pending receipt of more substantive information on this ..

Did you check the pick ticket showing these were pulled and checked before returning to the vendor?Â  They are on the return and show shipping out with the other material but Burndy is saying they were not included  in the return.
We need to see who picked and checked the return to be sure they were included and if they remember sending them back.

Freight was charged by R & L Carriers on POÂ 4703058608.Â  When we were charged, the only reference was the PO number.Â  We do not have a way to determine which invoice this ties back to.

Hi Matt!
Â 
We had permission from the Allentown branch to deliver this via our truck at $125.00.
Â 
Please see attached email between myself and Veronica from January.
Â 
We were able to save you guys around $175.00 on freight.
Â 
I always check with you guys before we ship anything other than collectâ€¦ is there an option to select prepaid and add to avoid this for future orders?

 Thanks!

Good afternoon Briana, 

Â  

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid. 

Â  

Thank you, 

Â

Good Morning!
Â 
Please see attached invoice: 128445
Â 
$137.50 is still due on this, and itâ€™s now over 90 days past due.
Â 
Please advise as to when we may see paymentâ€¦ Graybar in Greensboro, NC placed an order with us this morning, and Iâ€™m unable to process it until this is cleared up.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you for your help with this!

Hi Matt!
Â 
We had permission from the Allentown branch to deliver this via our truck at $125.00.
Â 
Please see attached email between myself and Veronica from January.
Â 
We were able to save you guys around $175.00 on freight.
Â 
I always check with you guys before we ship anything other than collectâ€¦ is there an option to select prepaid and add to avoid this for future orders?

 Thanks!

Good afternoon Briana, 

Â  

Invoice 128445 paid in the amount of $408.98.Â  This is the full amount of $533.98 minus $125.00 for freight. 


 The freight deduction of $125.00 was deducted for non compliance.Â  Our PO stated to ship Collect.Â  Since these instructions were not followed, the freight deduction is valid. 

Â  

Thank you, 

Â

Good Morning!
Â 
Please see attached invoice: 128445
Â 
$137.50 is still due on this, and itâ€™s now over 90 days past due.
Â 
Please advise as to when we may see paymentâ€¦ Graybar in Greensboro, NC placed an order with us this morning, and Iâ€™m unable to process it until this is cleared up.
Â 
Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you for your help with this!

Hi Sheryl,
Â 
I am not seeing credit note SC-09000647 in our system; which, it would appear, is why the debit memo 5111884894 was created. Â Please advise if the credit was applied internally on Kasonâ€™s end since Graybar is technically not showing a short  payment since we are not showing the credit as being received.
Â 
Â 
Thank you,
Â

Â 
Here is an email trail we have been going back and forth since December trying to get this paid.Â  Several copies of this invoice have been sent over the past couple months.Â  I need one email address to deal with  instead of constantly dealing with someone different each time.Â  Please see below.Â  The invoice has not been paid due to damage.Â  Graybar should have filed a freight claim from for this damage.Â  We are not responsible for that sort of damage.Â  If they are  defective meaning do not work we should have been notified months ago so they could have been replaced.
Â 
I have a prior email regarding the freight also.
Â 
Good Afternoon Justin,
Â 
Thank you for this follow up.Â  Lumax did comply with Graybarâ€™s shipping instructions.Â  Per that attached directions, we used the third carrier choice for New York which was New Penn Motors.Â  These fixtures had to ship by an LTL carrier  because UPS would have damaged these fixtures.Â  Please review and advise when this deduction will be paid.Â  We appreciate this recheck.

Â 
The reason this was deducted was due to non-compliance. Graybar provided shipping instructions that were not followed. Please see shipping instructions below:

1. For shipments less than 150 lbs. Ship UPS Collect: Billing Option- Bill Receiver. Graybar PO# must be entered in UPS Reference 1 or 2.
2.For shipments over 150 lbs. or those items exceeding UPS size limitations. If destined for a Graybar location ship LTL Collect. If destined for a non-Graybar location ship 3rd party billing to the  Graybar branch originating the purchase order using selected carriers on Graybar's Routing Guide. Contact BlueGrace Logistics for any routing guide questions.
3. For shipments over 7,500 lbs. or occupies 750 cubic feet or 7 pallet spaces, call for a truckload routing: BlueGrace Logistics at  1-813-980-0007 orgraybar@mybluegrace.com

 Can you please advise if Lumax Lighting was instructed to ship other than what is outlined above? If so, please provide supporting documentation. Although you didnâ€™t ship UPS, you had the ability to ship LTL collect.

Â 
Good Morning Dava,
Â 
Please review the attached credit memo from Graybar.Â  They are claiming non-compliance due to the decision on the carrier we use.Â  We had to use a LTL carrier because UPS would of damaged these fixtures. Please also see the attached list  from Graybar showing that in New York we can use New Penn Trucking which is what we did.Â  They are the third choice on the list.Â  Kindly review this with them and request full payment on this invoice.Â  Thank you for your help.

Donna,
Â 
They know this needs to be paid.Â  It was their issue not picking up on the fact that they had damaged freight. Â OnÂ  May the 4th I talked to Joe Griffin and he understood the freight needed to be paid.Â  Below is my last email  with him, they were asking for carrier information.Â  I will follow up again to see where this stands.Â  Thank you,
Â 
Good Afternoon Joe,
Â 
Thank you for this follow up.Â  The carrier was Ward Trucking, tracking number ALT-001-1445412.Â  We appreciate your help in getting this settled.Â  Please keep us updated.

Good Morning Sheryl,
Â 
When credits are issued/applied on your end and not sent to Graybar for processing on our end; Graybar is unaware that a credit has been given. Graybar deducted Debit Memo 5111884894 for material returned. Since Graybar only deducted once  for the returned material, the deduction is valid and invoice SI-090043429 cannot be short paid due to a valid deduction on another invoice. If you show the credit memo was deducted by Graybar, please provide the check/payment number where that deduction was  taken.
Â

Hi Sheryl,
Â 
I am not seeing credit note SC-09000647 in our system; which, it would appear, is why the debit memo 5111884894 was created. Â Please advise if the credit was applied internally on Kasonâ€™s end since Graybar is technically not showing a short  payment since we are not showing the credit as being received.

Can you help with this?
We shipped an order on our UPS acct and billed Graybar however according to Graybar we should have shipped on your UPSÂ account now the freight charge is being debited. The sales rep did not put the shipping information on theirÂ copy of the PO therefore we did not see Graybars shipping instructions.
I have attached the debit memo along with the weights and dimensions of the packages, can you have this quoted on your account and at least pay Bock the amount that it would have cost on your account?
thank you

Good morning,
I have been in communication with Joni regarding your payment on Check #30369129.Â  I have attached your check remittance and our payment detail.Â  You took a credit of -$1006.00 that is not available, which ended up short-paying Invoice  62186. I do not show a credit on your account for that amount.Â  If you have any documentation of that credit, please send it to me for further review.

HI.

 Please see attached copies.

 Two issues on this deduction:
 1. Price should $8.50 not $8.95 as we billed you $8.50 on INV1003425 (see attached). Please pay back $22.50 difference.
 2. As order was cancelled, Graybar is responsible to ship it back on your expense, so please pay back $46.82 you charged us for freight --DM 5110426597

 TOTAL PAY BACK AMOUNT IS $69.32.


 Thank you,

Good afternoon,

I have been emailing about this PO 4518970641 This order was not a freight allowed order. Attached is the email regarding the shipping. You folks did not pay the freight. I have attached a copy of the invoice  with the freight charge. I need to hear back from someone today as none of my previous emails have been answered. I have a PO 4519164056 for the same customer Rignet that will go on hold today if I cannot get this resolved today. Please get back to me today.

If a replacement was sent to Graybar, we would need the POD for the material.

Unfortunately, there is no RMA in the system for this return.Â  I can only assume that it is a warranty return which is not subject to credit as the  item was either repaired and returned or an advanced replacement was sent.

Linda, 

Â  

I have reached back out for the RMA.Â  I was able to locate more information on deduction 5110290629.Â  This ties back to PO 4518163000, invoice 2092444711. 

Â  

Matt T 

Â  

I am now denying this deduction taken.Â  I have been asking for a couple of months for the RMA.Â  I can only assume since there is no RMA in our system  that this was a warranty RMA that is not subject to credit.Â  Please issue payback for the deduction.
Â 
Best regards

Â 
I have attached to original PO sent from Graybar.
Please see the line item that shows the shipping charges of 469.64. This needs to be paid. WeÂ do not have anyone set up on freight allowed.Â 
Your terms are NET 30, but we have changed it to NET 60 as you will not pay us within the 30 day terms.

Where did you get that it would be freight allowed? We do not have anyone set up on freight allowed. Your original PO showed freight and that is the PO that was accepted. We did not authorize anything to go freight allowed. The freight needs to be paid.

Good afternoon Robin,
Regarding the freight deduction of $469.64 taken on invoice 04082038B, we are showing PO 4519297080 as freight allowed.Â  Since the PO is freight allowed, Graybar should not have been charged freight on shipments tied to this PO.
Thank you,
Matt T
Â 
Hi-Â 
Â 
Are you able to tell me if PO-Â 4519297080 is in the system to be paidÂ in the full amount ofÂ $10,479.67.
We received a debit memo in the amount of 469.64, your invoice 5110658865. This is a freight charge (shipping) that needs to be paid in full with the rest of the invoice. This was not billed in error. The shipping cost was also listed on your PO as well.Â

Hi Cynthia,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thanks for looking into this issue.
Â 
We billed Freight Collect as we do on every other location. If you speak with Paul Weiblen , he can explain the issue better. My understanding is that it was incorrectly set up as a Freight allowed PO, when it should have been set up as  a freight Collect Shipment. We had the same issue on a previous Invoice and Paul was able to work with the AP Department at Graybar and get that corrected and sent to us.
Â 
Please let me know if I can be of help in getting this straightened out.
Â

AP/Sheila/Orges,
Â 
Good afternoon.Â  I havenâ€™t received a response to the below email and am aware your scheduled payments are on the 10th.Â  I would like to confirm that the 1st 3 invoices on statement are  paid as they are past due.Â  Invoice # 00144092 on your website says that it is in process and not released which concerns me.Â  Also all the April invoices were slated for 5/10/2020 payment and are still open. Â I need a copy of the Debit for invoice # 00144122..Â   Please respond to this email.Â  Thank you.

There is no Appleton RMA. This material belonged to an In Stock Electric return which our warehouse at NJSC sent to Appleton in error. We originally deducted from Appleton on DM 5111707659 dtd 07/09/2019 UPS 1ZAW04010303974145  delivered 09/11/19 signed by Brooks.
Accounting reversed and deducted from In Stock Electric in error since the material was not returned to them.

 Accounts Receivable
 USAI

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 GENERAL: All orders are subject to acceptance of the Home Office of the company in New York. Title to merchandise passes to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier (unless our own trucks) regardless of whether-or-not transportation charges are paid or allowed  by the company. All orders are accepted contingent on our ability to secure necessary materials and labor. We do not assume responsibility for incomplete or delayed execution of orders. In the case of any special equipment described by catalog numbers which  do not appear in our price guide, we reserve the right to quote and sell only to the distributor who led us to develop this design for his customer.

 TERMS: 1% 10 Days Net 30 for credit approved open accounts. There will be a $10.00 handling charge added on orders totaling les than $100.00 net. PAST DUE ACCOUNTS: SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CHARGE EQUAL TO Â½% PER MONTH, BUT IN NO EVENT HIGHER THAN PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE LAW. In addition to such late payment service charges, costs and expenses associated with collection of past due amounts, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, shall be added to the amounts past due.

 DELIVERY: All shipments F.O.B., New Windsor, NY with surface freight allowed as follows (based on selling price value of individual shipments). Overnight shipments are not allowed regardless of value and carrier account numbers must be supplied. Partial releases  or shipments processed at the customerâ€™s request will be subject to these same allowances: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island $3,000.00 or more East of Mississippi River $3,500.00 or more West of Mississippi River $5,000.00 or more For shipments  of $5,000.00 or more to AK or HI, freight will be allowed to the West Coast. Freight from the West Coast to the final destination will be charged. For shipments to CN: Ontario East US $3,500.00 or more Manitoba West US $5,000.00 or more CN allowances are subject  to change subject to currency fluctuation.

 IMPORTANT:
 Freight allowances apply only to the base freight charges from the carrier. Any additional or extraordinary charges are not allowed and will be invoiced. This includes, but is not limited to, the following extra charges:
 - Call before notification â€“ Early AM delivery
 - Liftgate â€“ Residential/church delivery
 - Pallet jack â€“ Re-consignment fees
 - Fuel surcharge â€“ Local difficult delivery surcharges
 These are project specific charges over which we have no control, and as such, are not incorporated in our pricing.

 SHORTAGES/DAMAGES
 I.C.C. regulations state that all claims for SHORTAGES and DAMAGES (both visible and concealed) must be entered against the carrier within 15 days from receipt of shipment. Absolutely no claim will be allowed beyond 15 days. In case of loss or damage in transit,  consignee must make all claims with delivering carrier within normal time limits established by the I.C.C. We suggest immediate inspection of goods when received, and prompt filing of claims in case of breakage.

 RETURNS POLICY: All sales are final. However, in some cases returns may be allowed within 90 days after original shipment date. No products will be accepted for return without our written approval and unless accompanied by a properly authorized written â€˜Return  Authorization Requestâ€™ initiated by an appropriate USAI Employee. Return freight must be pre-paid. For non-special or non-custom products accepted for return a credit will be issued at the price invoiced, from which will be deducted the expense for return  transportation (if not prepaid) and a minimum restocking charge of 50% of the invoice value. Material returned without authorization will be accepted with no credit issued. Products appropriately returned for defects in material and workmanship, or error in  shipment will be accepted for full credit without service charge. Special or custom-made products including units that are modified from standard units cannot be returned for credit. Orders with an invoice value of less than $100.00 are not subject to return.

All warranty claims must be asserted within  one year from the date of shipment of the subject items; thereafter warranty claims will not be honored. Customerâ€™s sole remedy for a warranty claim or otherwise shall be limited to repair or replacement of the subject product if it is shown to have been defective  in material or workmanship at the time of shipment. USAIâ€™s sole and maximum liability for a defective product shall never exceed the cost of the subject product. Except for such warranty and exclusive remedy as stated, (and the express warranty of title),  we disclaim all other warranties, whether expressed or implied and specifically disclaim the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Therefore, the customerâ€™s sole and exclusive remedy against  us for breach of warranty, breach of contract, or in negligence or in strict liability or otherwise shall be limited to repair or replacement of the subject product at our option (excluding installation and removal charges which shall not be our liability)  or, if we choose, to refund the purchase price.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 GENERAL: All orders are subject to acceptance of the Home Office of the company in New York. Title to merchandise passes to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier (unless our own trucks) regardless of whether-or-not transportation charges are paid or allowed  by the company. All orders are accepted contingent on our ability to secure necessary materials and labor. We do not assume responsibility for incomplete or delayed execution of orders. In the case of any special equipment described by catalog numbers which  do not appear in our price guide, we reserve the right to quote and sell only to the distributor who led us to develop this design for his customer.

 TERMS: 1% 10 Days Net 30 for credit approved open accounts. There will be a $10.00 handling charge added on orders totaling les than $100.00 net. PAST DUE ACCOUNTS: SUBJECT TO A SERVICE CHARGE EQUAL TO Â½% PER MONTH, BUT IN NO EVENT HIGHER THAN PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE LAW. In addition to such late payment service charges, costs and expenses associated with collection of past due amounts, including reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees, shall be added to the amounts past due.

 DELIVERY: All shipments F.O.B., New Windsor, NY with surface freight allowed as follows (based on selling price value of individual shipments). Overnight shipments are not allowed regardless of value and carrier account numbers must be supplied. Partial releases  or shipments processed at the customerâ€™s request will be subject to these same allowances: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island $3,000.00 or more East of Mississippi River $3,500.00 or more West of Mississippi River $5,000.00 or more For shipments  of $5,000.00 or more to AK or HI, freight will be allowed to the West Coast.

 - Call before notification â€“ Early AM delivery
 - Liftgate â€“ Residential/church delivery
 - Pallet jack â€“ Re-consignment fees
 - Fuel surcharge â€“ Local difficult delivery surcharges
 These are project specific charges over which we have no control, and as such, are not incorporated in our pricing.

 SHORTAGES/DAMAGES
 I.C.C. regulations state that all claims for SHORTAGES and DAMAGES (both visible and concealed) must be entered against the carrier within 15 days from receipt of shipment. Absolutely no claim will be allowed beyond 15 days. In case of loss or damage in transit,  consignee must make all claims with delivering carrier within normal time limits established by the I.C.C. We suggest immediate inspection of goods when received, and prompt filing of claims in case of breakage.

 RETURNS POLICY: All sales are final. However, in some cases returns may be allowed within 90 days after original shipment date. No products will be accepted for return without our written approval and unless accompanied by a properly authorized written â€˜Return  Authorization Requestâ€™ initiated by an appropriate USAI Employee. Return freight must be pre-paid. For non-special or non-custom products accepted for return a credit will be issued at the price invoiced, from which will be deducted the expense for return  transportation (if not prepaid) and a minimum restocking charge of 50% of the invoice value. Material returned without authorization will be accepted with no credit issued. Products appropriately returned for defects in material and workmanship, or error in  shipment will be accepted for full credit without service charge.

Hello,
Â 
Thank you for choosing Zoro to bring you the products and services you need.Â 
I am contacting you regarding the past due balance of $13,768.16 for the CUST1031361 Graybar Electric account. This past due balance is causing new orders to stop for credit review. Attached is the full statement.
Itâ€™s important to understand that past due balances on your account put all buyers for your business at risk of having delays with order fulfillment through Zoro. We are releasing these orders stopping for credit review, but even when being released, they can be delayed from fulfilling upwards of 4 days (including weekends). In addition, if the past due balance isnâ€™t addressed, it could cause greater implications on new orders.

To avoid delays on order fulfillment, please provide details on the payment we may expect to receive.
Â 
If you have any questions please contact us at (800)-934-2693 or by email atcreditservices@zoro.com.Â  We are available Monday through Friday, 6:00am-5:30pm CT.

Hi Landon,
Â 
I received the attached debit memo (DM 5110909632 for $137.84 in freight), for recent PO 4519419924 shipping to Moncton NB in Canada just a couple weeks ago.Â  The DM states â€œfreight billed in errorâ€ â€“ but the PO and a supporting email from  you state that Graybar would pay the freight.Â  Iâ€™m hoping this was just an oversight and with your help maybe you can get this debit cancelled before it is actually deducted from Graybarâ€™s payment of our invoice.
Â 
A copy of the invoice is included in the attachment as well as the DM and purchase order.Â  Please let me know if I can provide anything else.
Â 
Thank you,
